Users will submit a good and price
Tool will determine actual price based on the input values

User will select a ship
Tool will determine that ships maximum cargo capacity and fuel consumption
User will input how much cash he has or can select how much of a product he wants to purchase (slider bar that displays both the value and the amount of goods)

User will select location to sell goods
Tool will calculate the distance and use the fuel consumption to determine cost of travel
Tool will calculate the amount of goods sold at the different price and return the profit or deficit for that trip

ToDo's later
Create where you can do multiple trips in one instance
	Example 1: User buys 2 products at A and sells one product at B and picks up another product and sells both products at C
	Example 2: User buys 1 product at A sells at B and then goes from B to C with a different product (essentially won't have to reset the tool and can see total profit for trip)
